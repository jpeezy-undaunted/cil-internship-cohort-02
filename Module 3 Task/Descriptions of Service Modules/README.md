# Description of the service models and their used cases
I will be discussing the three popular service models which are listed below.
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

## 1. Software as a Service (SaaS)
This is a service that offers on demand service pay per use of application software to users. This platform is independent and you do not need to install the software on a personal computer.The cloud runs a single instance of the software and makes it available for multiple end users. This makes cloud computing cheaper and other computing resources that are responsible in delivering SaaS are managed by the Vendor. This service is accessible by a web browser or a lightweight client application. This domain is for End users/customers.

**How do we Interract with SaaS**
- Direct Interaction: By going to the SaaS website or using their native app you can use their service.
- Client Applications: Third party Native applications that can communicate with the SaaS such as Outlook.
- Integrated Partners: Other SaaS companies that integrate with the SaaS such as Quickbooks, or MailChimp to expand on the feature set.
- Application Prpgramming Interface(API)’s: API’s allow you to code your own solutions that can communicate with SaaS provider.

To choose API's the following should be considered;
- Languages: API’s require you to use specific languages to communicate with them.
- Costs: cost scales with use, but can become astronomical.
- Limits: API’s generally have limits on usage which can be confusing to fully understand.

It should be noted that before deciding on which provider to purchase from, one should consider;
- data portability which allows you to export your data from SaaS solutions should there be need. Also, noted thst the data to ber exported might not be in a readable format or understandable format.
- Data Location: Many countries now require their citizens data to be stored on servers with their country. Some SaaS providers allow you to specify where data is stored.
- PCI/ HIPPA: Laws regarding how credit card/debit card and health information stipulate specific ways this data must be stored. Compliant SaaS providers follow these standards.

**Benefits of SaaS Business Model**
It should be noted that adopting SaaS business model is beneficial to both product vendors and customers.

Benefits of SaaS model to customers
- Lower Costs: SaaS platforms are distributed on a subscription basis. This eliminates licensing fees involved in traditional software installs. It also allows clients to increase or decrease their expenses based on usage. Additionally, because SaaS solutions are cloud-based, infrastructure costs for customers are eliminated.
- Flexibility & Scalability: The SaaS business model offers your customers greater flexibility. If you base your pricing on a usage metric, then your clients will only pay more if they’re using the product more often.
- Quick Benefits: SaaS tools are cloud-based, hence, clients see immediate gains. In most cases, it is as easy as signing up with a name and email address to instantly access product functions.
- Higher Adoption: The ability to use SaaS tools anywhere in the world has increased their adoption. If users experience immediate benefits from the software, the chances of sticking with the product are much higher.
- Free Upgrades: For many companies, downtime can be costly. In most cases, it happens during product upgrades. SaaS software upgrades are generally done without experiencing user downtime or with shorter maintenance windows.

Benefits of SaaS model to Vendors
- No Sales Friction: Most of the SaaS solutions are priced per user or per month. This price allows the end-users to calculate software costs easily. It eliminates the sales friction that can come as a result of IT budget approval.
- Recurring Revenue: One of the greatest benefits of the SaaS business model is that it allows a recurring stream of revenue which helps you control churn.
- Pivoting & Improvements: With SaaS, you can continuously update your product. That will help fine-tune your product so that you can increase retention and attract new customers in the process.
- Easier Free Trial Support: On-premise software support can be lengthy and tedious. With SaaS, you can provide support to users immediately as well as a free 7, 14 or 30-day trials. Thereupon, the user can continue with the free trial or upgrade to a paid level when they can.
- Easier to Update and Support: As a SaaS company owner, you control the system and the environment that the product is being developed in.
**Cons of SaaS**
- Portability and browser issues
- Internet performancev may dictate overall performance
- Compliance restriction.
**Use cases of SaaS**
The following are the cases where SaaS are used.
- Customer Relationship Management (CRM): These applications allow companies to manage customer information, track sales through their pipeline, and automate marketing functions.
Examples are Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics and HubSpot.
- Web hosting and E-commerce: Remote servers can deal with everything a business needs in its online presence.
Examples are BigCommerce, Shopify and Alibaba.
- Communication platforms: Sending instant messages and sharing files to enhance collaboration for teams based out of multiple locations.
Examples are Slack and Clickup.
- Accounting and invoicing: Some SaaS companies emphasize on billing and invoicing services. Others provide a full range of financial tracking and reporting services.
Example is QuickBooks.
- Email marketing software: This helps a company maintain communications with customers, build loyalty, increase brand recognition, and drive sales.
Examples are Gmail and Mailchimp.


## 2. Platform as a Service
This service is made up of a programming language execution environment, an operating system, a web server and a database. all of which encapsulate the environmment where users can build, compile and run their programs without worrying of the underlying infrastructure.
In this model, data and application resources are managed by the vendor/developer. It is a domain for developers, meaning developers uses PaaS.
This is essentially "web hosting" for your code as a developer. It is a serveless environment even as you need somewhere to run your code from. PaaS gives you a place to run your code without having to worry about the operating system maintenance.

**Things to note when choosing PaaS Provider**
- Price: Prices may change significantly after the first renewal period.
- Languages: Different PaaS vendors support different languages. Verify not just the language, but also the language version.
- ini File Editing: Verify you can edit ini files.
- Additional Tools: Tools such as curl may be required for your code.
- Security: DDoS Protection, Backup services and other security services can offer a base level of protection for your app and services.
- Compliance: PCI, HIPPA and other compliance may be provided by some vendors.

**Characteristics of PaaS**
The following are notable features of PaaS.
- PaaS offers browser based development environment. It allows the developer to create database and edit the application code either via Application Programming Interface or point-and-click tools.
- PaaS provides built-in security, scalability, and web service interfaces.
- PaaS provides built-in tools for defining workflow, approval processes, and business rules.
- It is easy to integrate PaaS with other applications on the same platform.
- PaaS also provides web services interfaces that allow us to connect the applications outside the platform.

**Why Use PaaS?**
The following are the *benefits or Pros* why you should use PaaS as a Developer or a vendor.
- Lower administrative overhead: Customer need not bother about the administration because it is the responsibility of cloud provider.
- Lower total cost of ownership: Customer need not purchase expensive hardware, servers, power, and data storage.
- Scalable solutions: It is very easy to scale the resources up or down automatically, based on their demand.
- More current system software: It is the responsibility of the cloud provider to maintain software versions and patch installations.

**Cons of PaaS**
The folllowing are issues you may likely face when you decide to go with PaaS model.
- Lack of portability between PaaS clouds: Although standard languages are used, yet the implementations of platform services may vary. For example, file, queue, or hash table interfaces of one platform may differ from another, making it difficult to transfer the workloads from one platform to another.
- Event based processor scheduling: The PaaS applications are event-oriented which poses resource constraints on applications, i.e., they have to answer a request in a given interval of time.
- Security engineering of PaaS applications: Since PaaS applications are dependent on network, they must explicitly use cryptography and manage security exposures.

**Use cases of PaaS**
There is a multitude of use cases for PaaS, in a wide range of business contexts. Below are some of the most important ones, as listed by Gartner.
- API Development and Management
PaaS is useful for companies that develop, run, and manage app programming interfaces and microservices. This also goes for the development of new APIs and end-to-end API management.
Facebook is an example of PaaS because developers can create specific applications for the Facebook platform using proprietary APIs and make the application available to any Facebook users
- Business Intelligence and Analytics
PaaS tools allow for advanced analysis of business data, to identify patterns, make predictions, and ultimately make more qualified and data-driven decisions. PaaS tools can help companies predict behaviors and events so that they’re able to plan better.
Power BI by microsoft is an example of PaaS.
- Databases and Data Management
PaaS is suitable for setting up and managing an organization’s database. PaaS provides a scalable, secure, and on-demand platform for creating, administering, and maintaining databases. As research firm Forrester puts it: “The shift to the cloud for big data is on.”
Some examples are Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, MySQL, IBM Db2, Apache Cassandra, MongoDB, CouchBase and mant others.
- Communication and Collaboration
One of the great things about PaaS is that it can be a delivery mechanism for communication and collaboration. This means that features like voice, chat, and videos can be added to applications built on the PaaS.
- Worker Systems
A worker system is an essential part of any production-scale cloud application. The ability to run tasks in the background, process tasks at scale, or schedule jobs to run on regular schedules is crucial for handling the types of workloads and processing demands typical in a distributed application.
The Ironworker platform is an example of PaaS making life easier for users.
- Internet of Things
With the explosive growth in IoT (Internet of Things), PaaS will play an increasingly important role. PaaS supports various programming languages, application environments, and tools, allowing for the connectivity and integrations needed in IoT deployments.

Other samples of PaaS are AWS Beanstalk and Google App Engine.

## 3. Infrastructure as a Service IaaS
Infrastructure as a Service, refers to cloud based services that are not full end user functional products of themselves. Google Drive is an SaaS, AWS Glacier is IaaS.
This service provides the architecture and infrastructure.  It provides all computing resources but in a virtual environment so multiple users can have access. The resources include data storage, virtualization, servers, and networking.  Most vendors are responsible for managing them.  If you use this service, you are responsible for handling other resources including applications, data, runtime, and middleware.  This is mostly for SysAdmins. IaaS service providers are Amazon EC2, Go Grid and Rackspace.com .
**Pros of IaaS**
- The cloud provide the Infrastruture
- Enhanced Scalabilty: Dynamic eorkaloads are supported.
- The product and services offered by the vendor is flexible.
**Cons of IaaS**
- There is usually security issues.
- Network and service delays

The following are some examples of companies that uses cloud computing;
- Amazon's AWS:  When you talk about companies using cloud computing, Amazon Web Services leads the pack.  It offers IaaS and PaaS to all their customers.
- Google Cloud:This cloud platform is universal for Google's enormous ecosystem and for other products such as Microsoft Office.  It provides storage of data and collaboration along with other services that are included in their cloud computing suite.
- Microsoft Azure: Offered by Microsoft, it provides SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS for its software and developer tools.  If you have used Office 365, then you have used SaaS.
- IBM Smart Cloud: This offers private, public, and hybrid distribution platforms providing a full range of SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS cloud computing services for businesses.  The pay as you go platform generates profits for IBM.

Other examples are Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Magneto 1 Enterprise Edition, AWS EC2 and Google Compute Engine.
