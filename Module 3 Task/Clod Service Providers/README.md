### COnclusion
Microsoft Azure and AWS are necks to neck in the race of cloud supremacy. Both offer similar products, services, and costs. However, Google, IBM, and other clouds are getting better each day.
If I were to choose a cloud provider for my business, it would have to be Azure or AWS. The reason is obvious: both companies are way ahead in the race. You cannot go wrong with either of these. I will also consider the languages that I good at and support the cloud service prodvider.
If there are some specific tools and services offered by other clouds, you may end up deciding upon alternatives as well. For example, IBM Watson is a unique product used in IBM’s cloud service.
Most large enterprises use multiple clouds. Most clients uses AWS for file storage and messaging, Azure for DevOps, database and developer tools, and Google’s cloud for documents and emails.
Finally, One size doesn’t fit all. You need to figure out what your needs are, and which cloud fits you the best.
